# pkgjs/action

Use the `pkgjs/action` workflow to automatically add new versions of Node.js to your test matrix.

## Basic usage

1. Define a miminum supported Node.js version in your `package.json`, e.g.

```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": "^16 || ^14 || ^12"
  }
}
```

2. Create a file (e.g. `ci.yaml`) in your `.github/workflows/` folder:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test:
    uses: pkgjs/action/.github/workflows/node-test.yaml@main
    with:
      upgrade-policy: lts           # optional
```

With the above configuration, a test matrix will be created with all the Node.js LTS versions starting from v12. In January, 2022, the above example would yield the following versions: 16, 14, 12 (LTS releases which will not be removed from the matrix), as well as 17 (current non-LTS release - will be removed from the matrix when the support ends).

By default, the test script will check out your repository, execute `npm install` and then execute an `npm test` using the latest Node.js version in every release line in the test matrix.
